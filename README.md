# GeoSPARQL Extensions Ontology
This is an extension to the [GeoSPARQL](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosparql) OWL ontology that includes details GeoSPARQL doesn't have for indicating spatial resolution, areas, proportional relations (e.g. area overlaps) and roles for multiple `Geometry` objects relating to a single `Feature`.

This ontology is online at its namespae location: **<http://linked.data.gov.au/def/geox>**.

This extension is mostly built on GeoSPARQL but it also uses elements from the [AGLDWG datatypes vocabulary](http://catalogue.linked.data.gov.au/resource/116).
