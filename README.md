# GeoSPARQL Extensions Ontology
This is an extension to the [GeoSPARQL](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosparql) OWL ontology that includes details GeoSPARQL doesn't have for indicating spatial resolution, areas, proportional relations (e.g. area overlaps) and roles for multiple `Geometry` objects relating to a single `Feature`.

This extension is mostly built on GeoSPARQL but it also uses elements from [QUDT](http://www.qudt.org/release2/qudt-catalog.html) and the [AGLDWG datatypes vocabulary](http://catalogue.linked.data.gov.au/resource/116).


## Status
As of June, 2019, this ontology is at an early stage of development.
