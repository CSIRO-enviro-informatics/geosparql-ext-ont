# GeoSPARQL Extensions Ontology
This is an extension to the [GeoSPARQL](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosparql) OWL ontology that includes details GeoSPARQL doesn't have for indicating spatial resolution, areas, proportional relations (area overlaps) and roles for multiple `Geometry` objects relating to a single `Feature`.

This extension is mostly built on GeoSPARQL but it also defined specialised versions of the Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) Ontology's *ObservableProperty* class for spatial properties of spatial features, such as *Area*.


## Status
As of early MArch, 2019, this ontology is at an early stage of development.
